# TDKChatRoom
<br/>
<br/><strong>Summary</strong>
<p>This is an exercise to develop a chat server.  The goal was to handle a few clients, and be able to provide the last 10 lines of chat histtory when a new client connects.  The whole thing can be brought up from a bash script, which starts 3 clients, uses some canned text as inputs
and captures the outputs.  The outputs are validated against known good output.</p>
